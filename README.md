# Cloud-Based Minecraft Server Hub

This web interface streamlines the creation and management of cloud-based virtual machine (VM) instances using AWS and SQL. It automates software installation on new instances and continuously monitors their status.

Minecraft is initialized on VM instances using an init script provided by AWS from this website:

A demonstration of the web interface may be viewed on YouTube:
